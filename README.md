**Why is this project of interest?**
\
As university students, we have loads of assignments, tests to 
study for, clubs to attend. The clutter of tasks we need to complete
can sometimes get very messy and difficult to keep track of. This 
application will aim to get rid of this clutter and keep a list of
your tasks organized.
